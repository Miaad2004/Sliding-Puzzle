## How To Solve The Table?
> There is always an unoccupied tile that can be moved by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard. Tiles in the same row or column as the unoccupied tile can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in ascending numerical order.

# How Does It Work?
## Generating a Random Table
> Player movements are simulated multiple times(based on the difficulty level) therefore there is no need to check if the table is solvable or not after the shuffling.

## Graphical Table
> Tables bigger than 4 by 4 are printed as numbers rather than graphical objects.

## How Are The Scores Calculated?
> Scores are calculated based on the table size, difficulty level, number of movements & the time taken.
